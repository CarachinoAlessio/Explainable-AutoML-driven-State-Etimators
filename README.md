# ML techniques for State Estimation
This repo contains the code of my Master's Thesis. Specifically, it consists in exploring different techniques(Explanable AI, Physics Informed NN, ...) to perform State Estimation

## Current stage
Still pretty far from the finish line. Let's say project is at 10%
