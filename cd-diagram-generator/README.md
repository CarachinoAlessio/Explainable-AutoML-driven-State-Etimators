# Critical Difference Diagrams 
This directory contains the both the plots and the results collected by running the techniques described in the Thesis.

Specifically, as for the plots, this folder contains only the critical difference diagrams (based on the Wilcoxon-Holm method to detect pairwise significance).

They are generated thanks to the authors' repository reachable at the following address: https://github.com/hfawaz/cd-diagram. Small changes have been made on their implementation of ```main.py``` just to adapt to a regression case, following their own guidelines.
